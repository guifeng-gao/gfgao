abstract: Mangrove ecosystems are an important component of “blue carbon”. However, it is not clear whether the stems play roles in the CH4 budget ofmangrove ecosystems. This study investigated the CH4 emission from mangrove stems and its potential driving factors. We set up six sample plots in the Zhangjiang Estuary National Mangrove Nature Reserve, where Kandelia obovata, Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculata are the main mangrove tree species. Soil properties such as total carbon content, redox potential and salinity were determined in each plot. The dynamic chamber methodwas used to measuremangrove stems and soil CH4 fluxes. Combined field survey results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of soil properties, we divided the six plots into two sites (S1 and S2) to perform statistical analyses of stem CH4 fluxes. Then the CH4 fluxes from mangrove tree stems and soil were further scaled up to the ecosystem level through themapping model. Under different backgrounds ofsoil properties, salinity and microbial biomass carbonwere themain factors modified soil CH4 fluxes in the two sites, and further affected the stemCH4 fluxes ofmangroves. The soil ofboth sites are sources ofCH4, and the soil CH4 emission of S2 was about twice higher than that of S1. Results of upscaling model showed that mangrove stems in S1 were CH4 sinks with −105.65 g d−1. But stems in S2 were CH4 sources around 1448.24 g d−1. Taken together, our results suggested that CH4 emission frommangrove soils closely depends on soils properties. Andmangrove stemswere found to act as both CH4 sources and CH4 sinks depend on soil CH4 production. There- fore, when calculating theCH4 budget ofthemangrove ecosystem, the contribution ofmangrove plant stems can not be ignored.
